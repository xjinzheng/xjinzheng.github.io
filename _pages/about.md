Hi! I'm Gin, a mainland Chinese undergraduate student at National Taiwan University. I'll be graduating in June 2020 with a major in Economics and a minor in Political Science. Prior to my senior year, I spent one year exchange at the Department of Political Science, University of California, San Diego. Starting from fall 2020, I will be studying at University of Chicago pursuing my master degree in computational economics.

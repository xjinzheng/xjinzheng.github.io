Hi! I'm Gin, a mainland Chinese undergraduate student at National Taiwan University. I'll be graduating in June 2020 with a major in Economics and a minor in Political Science. Also, I'll be holding two certificated programs in Communication and Data Science for Social Inquiry. Prior to my senior year, I spent one year exchange at the Department of Political Science, University of California, San Diego. Currently, I'm applying for Master programs in the United States and seeking for intern opportunities for summer 2020.

My intended research interests would mainly rest on political communication. Given the infusion of technology in our modern media world, together with my experiences in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, I aim to understand how do the novel technologies influence different realms of political communication, such as opinions control, internet polarization, and business intelligence, with a focus on the conflicts and cooperations seen among Greater China area. Since I'm highly proficient in R, Python and Stata, I developed strong background in conducting quantitative research. In addition, I hope to further enhance my skills in text analysis and network analysis through rigorous statistics study.

My parents named me 晓今 after the meaning of _Carpe Diem_, lecturing me to seize the moment right now, hence to apprehend and appreciate the experiences rather than the outcomes. Throughout the life-changing period of spending my college life across the Taiwan strait, although I accumulated many precious friendships and worked to build bridges between the mutual incomprehension, hardships stemming from policy restrictions placed on mainland Chinese students in Taiwan toughened me, and rendered me the opportunity to witness today's tensions of Greater China area. Being sandwiched between antagonistic positions, I see both the possibilities and the difficulties to embrace teared groups of people no matter domestically or internationally. That said, I assume it is the courage to continue contributing to peace that counts, and it is also true anywhere else. I believe we are international, and I anticipate a community of shared future for mankind. In the near future, I wish to pursue academia to commit to the truth in a nutshell.

Hi! I'm Gin, a mainland Chinese undergraduate student at National Taiwan University. I'll be graduating in June 2020 with a major in Economics and a minor in Political Science. Also, I'll be holding two certificated programs in Communication and Data Science for Social Inquiry. Prior to my senior year, I spent one year exchange at the Department of Political Science, University of California, San Diego. Currently, I'm applying for Master programs in the United States and seeking for intern opportunities on summer 2020.

My intended research interests would mainly rest on political communication. Given the infusion of technology in our modern media world, together with my familarities and concerns of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, I aim to understand how does the novel technologies influence different aspects of political communication, such as opinions regulation, internet polarization, and business intelligence, with a focus in the conflicts and cooperations seen among Great China area. Since I'm highly proficient in R, Python and Stata, I develop strong background in conducting quantitative researches. In addition, I hope to further enhance my skills in text analysis and network analysis through rigorous statistics study.

My parents named me 晓今 with the meaning of _Carpe Diem_. Apart from academia, I received musical training in Piano and Vocal Music earlier during my childhood, leading me to enjoying Gospel music and classical Chinese folk music, yet I once made effort in intergrating into the rock world. Similarly as my life-changing experience of spending my college life across the Taiwan strait, altough I accumulated many precious friendships and worked to build bridges between the mutual incomprehension across the strait, hardships of policy restrictions placed on mainland Chinese students in Taiwan toughened me and rendered me the opportunity to witness today's tensions of Great China area.

Hi! I'm Gin, a mainland Chinese undergraduate student at National Taiwan University. I'll be graduating in June 2020 with a major in Economics and minor in Political Science, with two certificated programs in Communication and Data Science for Social Inquiry. Currently, I'm applying for Master programs in the United States and seeking for intern opportunities on summer 2020.

Independent Research (on-going), Oct. 2019

Using the cases of decentralized technology-based media platforms taking place in Hong Kong, this article seeks to examine the platformsâ€™ contribution to two aspects of their social impact: (1) the expansion of audience reach on social movements and (2) the empowerment of personal expression on critical issues. Drawing upon the scraped time series viewing data and Google searching data of Telegram, an instant messaging phone app, together with the open textual data from Matters Lab, an online blogging community, this article investigates the substantial attention drawn from subscribers of protest-info channels on Telegram and the salient topics being discussed on Matters Lab. 

Keywords: Decentralized Technology, Media, Social Engagement, Security, Hong Kong

This report on the topic of RCEP is to explain the RCEP as the current, major trade agreement in the geographical area of Pacific-Asia as well as assessing its consequences on relevant countriesâ€™ medicine industries derived from IP rights. This agreement strongly shapes Asian regionalism and is therefore of paramount importance for the future development of the region and thus

[COGS108]Data Science in Practice, UCSD, Spring 2019

In this project, we examined the relationship between the trendiness on the Google search engine of 3 Democratic 2020
Presidential candidates and their fundraising results from the start of the announcements of each of their candidacies to the end of
March (limit of Federal Electoral Committee data). For fundraising results of each candidate, we focus on three columns: total
contributions raised, number of unique donors, and total contribution amount for each US Division (defined by the US Census
Bureau). By analyzing the trendiness of candidates on Google to fundraising results, we endeavor to explore the relationship
between one's digital popularity and his/her success in fundraising during the same period of time (if a relationship exists at all).

Keywords: Democratic Candidates, Google Search Trendiness, Election Fundraising
